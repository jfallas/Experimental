### FBOpen

[FBOpen Website API] (http://18f.github.io/fbopen/apidocs/)

Need to apply for an API key.

### Data.Gov

Data is not well organized, nor in a common format.  Mileage varies greatly on the Organization
providing the data.  DHS CBP data is mostly in PDF format??  Seems like there is work being done
to make data available via a common REST API interface, like the FBOpen one, but not too many
agencies supporting this yet.

Some JSON data is available, but hard to understand structure.  Would have to download the data
and host locally depending on the data set wanted to use.  Going to have to take challenge on a case
by case basis and adapt accordingly.
